As a developer, I want to write documentation in a .txt file that describes the details and 
functionality of my – operator overload. I want to include details such as “syntax”, “parameters”, 
“return type”, and an example of it being used, with the output. 

 EXample of "-"Operator:

public static CustomList<T> operator - (CustomList<T> listOne, CustomList<T> listTwo)
        {
            
            for (int i = 0; i < listTwo.Count; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < listOne.Count; j++)
                {
                    if (listTwo[i].Equals(listOne[j]))
                    {
                        listOne.Remove(listTwo[i]);
                        break;

                    }
                }               

            }
            return listOne;
        }
